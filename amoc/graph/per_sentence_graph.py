"""
Per-Sentence Graph: A constraint-first, sentence-local graph view.

This module provides a clean abstraction for per-sentence plot construction
that guarantees:
1. Only explicit and carry-over nodes appear in the graph
2. Inactive nodes are completely excluded (nodes, edges, metrics)
3. Connectivity is maintained by construction, not by repair

The design makes disconnection impossible by encoding all constraints
directly into the construction rules.
