"A student conducted an experiment in science class. The experiment focused on water and temperature. The student placed water into a clear container. A thermometer was used to measure the temperature of the water. The student then added a small amount of salt to the water. After adding the salt, the student observed a slight change in temperature. The measurements were written down in a notebook. The student repeated the experiment to make sure the results were accurate. The results showed that salt affected the freezing point of the water. This helped the student understand how substances can change physical properties. The experiment also showed why careful measurement is important in science."
