Concepts nodes represent objects or persons from the story and are generally represented by nouns in the text.

An edge connects a concept to another concept or a concept to a property, and it is described by a relationship between the connected nodes.

Nodes (with their types, and a score of how central they are in the story (0 is most central, 1 less central, etc.)):
{nodes_from_graph}

Edges (relationships between the nodes):
{edges_from_graph}

IMPORTANT: Some concept nodes represent persons whose age or educational level is explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the text (for example: "8-year-old boy", "primary school student", "high school student", "college freshman", "university student"). When you generate relationships, you must take this age or educational level into account so that the relationships reflect what that person is realistically able to understand.

If the age or education level is not mentioned, do NOT invent it. In that case, just create reasonable relationships supported by the text without making assumptions about their level of understanding.

Always base every edge strictly on information that is stated or clearly implied in the text. Age and education should influence:
- which edges you choose to include (more concrete vs more abstract),
- how you phrase the relation (e.g., 'plays_with' vs 'researches', 'learns_about' vs 'teaches').

I want you to tell me the relationships (edges) between the nodes from the text themselves. And also between the nodes from the text and the other nodes from the graph (here prioritize the relationships based on the score). The text is:

IMPORTANT CONNECTIVITY CONSTRAINT: Every relationship you output must include:
- at least one node from the extracted text nodes list ({nodes_from_text}), AND
- at least one node that already exists in the graph nodes list ({nodes_from_graph}).

Do NOT output relationships that only connect new text nodes to other new text nodes if neither side attaches to the existing graph.
