"Scientific models are used to explain complex systems. A model simplifies reality by focusing on key variables. Researchers use models to test hypotheses about how systems behave. A model does not perfectly represent the real world. Instead, it provides a useful approximation for understanding patterns. When new data are collected, the predictions of a model can be evaluated. Sometimes the data support the model’s assumptions. In other cases, the data contradict the model’s predictions. When contradictions occur, researchers must revise or replace the model. This process shows how scientific knowledge changes over time. Evidence and critical evaluation play a central role in this process."
